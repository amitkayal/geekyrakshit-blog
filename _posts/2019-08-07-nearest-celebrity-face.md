# Nearest Celebrity Face using Deep Learning

## Face Recognition

Face Recognition is one of the more interesting applications of Deep Learning i. At a single glance, it may seem like a simple classification problem; classify if this photo shows Soumik’s face or Souranil’s. You might be quick to jump to the conclusion, oh, the handsome face on the right belongs to Soumik and the ugly face on the left belongs to Souranil but, Ahem!!! We beg to differ.
